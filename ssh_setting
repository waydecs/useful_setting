SSH login without password
Instructions below work for Linux and Mac machines

1) Generate a pair of authentication keys on the local machine 
   Run ssh-keygen -t rsa
2) Connect to the server and create a directory ~/.ssh
   Run ssh [username]@[hostname] mkdir -p .ssh
3) Append local machine's public key to the server
   Run cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh [username]@[hostname] 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
4) Now you can log into [username]@[hostname] from the local machine without password
